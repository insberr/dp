## Ideas
- A sort of to-do list of tasks/assignments which can be added onto the schedule. Think of it as a list of assignments and you can drag and drop them onto the schedule to plan the time to do them. This is not limited to assignments or drag and drop (especially mobile), just needed a way to describe the idea. Like a list of things you know you need to do, but you want to plan when to do them later.
- Sepererate schedule's of a sort. basically calendars, but you could create then for things like class schedule, daily routine/chores, assignemt plans, daily drink water reminders, etc.
- Something that automatically adjusts your schedule as the day goes on. Life happens. Some scheduled things cant be moved (classes, meetings, etc), some can be moved or even split up (time to do assignments), some can even be added or removed (play video games, watch youtube, go on a walk). Something that you can easily input into, and it handles a lot of the complexity of planning it out and also automates

## Thoughts
> So like if a segment of my day looked like:  
> Monday:
> - 1pm - 2pm class
> - 2pm - 2:15pm read messages
> - 2:15 - 3pm work x assignment
> - 3pm - 4pm game team meeting
> - 4pm - 6pm make dinner and meals for the week
> - 6pm - 6:30 do simple code assignemnt
> - 6:30 - 7pm do other simple code assignment
> - 7pm - --       go to bed
> 
> Here's a realistic (except for the times) scenario for me, personally:  
> Say my 1-2pm class ends a bit late and I needed to talk to the professor. Keep note of this as now I don't have time to read my messages and might even have lost time to work on the assignment.
> 
> Now its 2:30, 30 minutes before game team meeting. I could work on that assignment I planned for, but it's large and tough. I would rather have a whole hour to just focus on it. So now I am doing the simple assignment I planned to do later.
> 
> Later at 4pm, I get back home from an extra exhausting game team meeting and I have a million teams messages and emails to sift through. And I also don't wanna make food at the moment.
> 
> Now I feel bad because I haven't stuck to the plan, and now I am home unsure of what to do and when to do it because life fucking happened and I wasn't able to follow the schedule perfectly. I could spend the next hour re-planning the rest of my day - all of that stuff has to get done today - but that would take up a lot of my time that I could be doing things.
> Now here I am, sitting on the couch watching youtube because I am lost. I need a break for a moment. I say screw the 7pm bedtime, I'll just stay up until I am done. Now I feel really unorganized and will probably be up till 12pm.
> 
> -# please note, 7pm bedtime is made up. I go to bed more around 10-11pm
> 
> It would've been great if as my day goes on, I can very easily "this didn't go as planned" and then my schedule accommodate that. Of course some things like meetings and classes cant be moved, but a majority of those things can be. Some could even be shortened, removed (just not that important), added, moved to another day. But it would take me too much time than I am willing to spend to be constantly doing all of that as my day goes on.

> Simplified version: plans never go as expected and trying to follow a schedule doesn't accommodate for that. and trying to re-plan the schedule throughout the day is wasted time. A schedule that can adjust itself as things happen, that would be great.

> I don't want to follow the schedule. I want the schedule to follow me, but still guide me towards good time management.
