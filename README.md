## Ideas
- A sort of to-do list of tasks/assignments which can be added onto the schedule. Think of it as a list of assignments and you can drag and drop them onto the schedule to plan the time to do them. This is not limited to assignments or drag and drop (especially mobile), just needed a way to describe the idea. Like a list of things you know you need to do, but you want to plan when to do them later.
- Sepererate schedule's of a sort. basically calendars, but you could create then for things like class schedule, daily routine/chores, assignemt plans, daily drink water reminders, etc.
